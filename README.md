## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    bun expo start
   ```

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
bun run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
